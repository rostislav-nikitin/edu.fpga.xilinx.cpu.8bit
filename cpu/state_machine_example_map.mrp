Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   4
Number of warnings :   1

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:MapLib:979 - LUT5 symbol "run_rstpot" (output signal=run_rstpot) has input
   signal "s_next" which will be trimmed. See Section 5 of the Map Report File
   for details about why the input signal will become undriven.
ERROR:MapLib:979 - LUT5 symbol "run_rstpot" (output signal=run_rstpot) has input
   signal "s_current" which will be trimmed. See Section 5 of the Map Report
   File for details about why the input signal will become undriven.
ERROR:MapLib:978 - LUT5 symbol "run_rstpot" (output signal=run_rstpot) has an
   equation that uses input pin I0, which no longer has a connected signal.
   Please ensure that all the pins used in the equation for this LUT have
   signals that are not trimmed (see Section 5 of the Map Report File for
   details on which signals were trimmed).
ERROR:MapLib:978 - LUT5 symbol "run_rstpot" (output signal=run_rstpot) has an
   equation that uses input pin I2, which no longer has a connected signal.
   Please ensure that all the pins used in the equation for this LUT have
   signals that are not trimmed (see Section 5 of the Map Report File for
   details on which signals were trimmed).

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal dummy connected to top level port dummy has been
   removed.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network s_IBUF has no load.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------

   1. part of a cycle
   2. part of disabled logic
   3. a side-effect of other trimmed logic

 Unused block "dummy" (FF) removed.
  The signal "s_current" is unused and has been removed.
   Unused block "s_current" (FF) removed.
    The signal "s_next" is unused and has been removed.
     Unused block "s_next_INV_0" (BUF) removed.
The signal "dummy" is unused and has been removed.
 Unused block "dummy_OBUF" (BUF) removed.
Unused block "dummy.PAD" (PAD) removed.

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
