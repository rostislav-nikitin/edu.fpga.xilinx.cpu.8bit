Mapping design into LUTs...
ERROR:MapLib:979 - LUT5 symbol "run_rstpot" (output signal=run_rstpot) has input
   signal "s_next" which will be trimmed. See Section 5 of the Map Report File
   for details about why the input signal will become undriven.
ERROR:MapLib:979 - LUT5 symbol "run_rstpot" (output signal=run_rstpot) has input
   signal "s_current" which will be trimmed. See Section 5 of the Map Report
   File for details about why the input signal will become undriven.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal dummy connected to top level port dummy has been
   removed.
ERROR:MapLib:978 - LUT5 symbol "run_rstpot" (output signal=run_rstpot) has an
   equation that uses input pin I0, which no longer has a connected signal.
   Please ensure that all the pins used in the equation for this LUT have
   signals that are not trimmed (see Section 5 of the Map Report File for
   details on which signals were trimmed).
ERROR:MapLib:978 - LUT5 symbol "run_rstpot" (output signal=run_rstpot) has an
   equation that uses input pin I2, which no longer has a connected signal.
   Please ensure that all the pins used in the equation for this LUT have
   signals that are not trimmed (see Section 5 of the Map Report File for
   details on which signals were trimmed).
